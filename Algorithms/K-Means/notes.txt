K - Means

What is K-Means?
    It is a type of unsupervised algorithm which  solves the clustering problem. 
    Its procedure follows a simple and easy  way to classify a given data set through a certain number of  clusters (assume k clusters). 
    Data points inside a cluster are homogeneous and heterogeneous to peer groups.

How K-means forms cluster:

    1.K-means picks k number of points for each cluster known as centroids.
    2.Each data point forms a cluster with the closest centroids i.e. k clusters.
    3.Finds the centroid of each cluster based on existing cluster members. Here we have new centroids.
    4.As we have new centroids, repeat step 2 and 3. Find the closest distance for each data point from new centroids and get associated with new k-clusters. Repeat this process until convergence occurs i.e. centroids does not change.

Python Code
==============
#Import Library
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
#Assumed you have, X (attributes) for training data set and x_test(attributes) of test_dataset
# Create KNeighbors classifier object model 
k_means = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0)
# Train the model using the training sets and check score
model.fit(X)
#Predict Output
predicted= model.predict(x_test)

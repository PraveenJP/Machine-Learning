KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)

What is KNN?
    It can be used for both classification and regression problems. 
    However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. 
    K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases by a majority vote of its k neighbors. 
    The case being assigned to the class is most common amongst its K nearest neighbors measured by a distance function.

Python Code
==============

#Import Library
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
#Assumed you have, X (predictor) and Y (target) for training data set and x_test(predictor) of test_dataset
# Create KNeighbors classifier object model 
KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6) # default value for n_neighbors is 5
# Train the model using the training sets and check score
model.fit(X, y)
#Predict Output
predicted= model.predict(x_test)

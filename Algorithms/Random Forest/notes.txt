Random Forest

What is Random Forest?
    Random Forest is a trademark term for an ensemble of decision trees. 
    In Random Forest, we’ve collection of decision trees (so known as “Forest”). 
    To classify a new object based on attributes, each tree gives a classification and we say the tree “votes” for that class. 
    The forest chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest).

Each tree is planted & grown as follows:

    1.If the number of cases in the training set is N, then sample of N cases is taken at random but with replacement. This sample will be the training set for growing the tree.
    2.If there are M input variables, a number m<<M is specified such that at each node, m variables are selected at random out of the M and the best split on these m is used to split the node. The value of m is held constant during the forest growing.
    3.Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible. There is no pruning.

Python Code
=============

#Import Library
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
#Assumed you have, X (predictor) and Y (target) for training data set and x_test(predictor) of test_dataset
# Create Random Forest object
model= RandomForestClassifier()
# Train the model using the training sets and check score
model.fit(X, y)
#Predict Output
predicted= model.predict(x_test)

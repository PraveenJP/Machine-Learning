SVM(Support Vector Machine)

What is SVM?
    It is a classification method. In this algorithm, 
    we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate.

Python code
==============
#Import Library
from sklearn import svm
#Assumed you have, X (predictor) and Y (target) for training data set and x_test(predictor) of test_dataset
# Create SVM classification object 
model = svm.svc() # there is various option associated with it, this is simple for classification. You can refer link, for more detail.
# Train the model using the training sets and check score
model.fit(X, y)
model.score(X, y)
#Predict Output
predicted= model.predict(x_test)
